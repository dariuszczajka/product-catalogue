## Pages

#### / (product view)
Main page of the web application, it contains a navbar with searchbar, 2 filters which can be applied using checkboxes and a log in button.

Depending on your search query and/or filter choices you will see products listed (8 per page) or an empty list if there is no product matching your requirements.

If products matching your description exceeds 8 - you'll be able to use pagination, which is implemented at the bottom.


#### /login
Used to login into website.  

This page is pretty simple - in order to login you'll need to use the form on the right side. (Forgot password button does nothing for now - i hope you remember your password ðŸ˜…)

## Room for Improvement
